.SH NAME
iavf \-This file describes the Linux* Virtual Function Driver
for Intel(R) Ethernet Adaptive Virtual Function Driver.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe iavf
.PD 1v
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver is intended for \fB2.6.32\fR and newer kernels. A version of the driver may already be included by your distribution and/or the kernel.org kernel.

It can only be activated on kernels with CONFIG_PCI_IOV enabled. SR-IOV requires the correct platform and OS support.
.LP
The iavf driver supports virtual functions generated by the underlying PF driver, with one or more VFs enabled through sysfs. The guest OS loading the iavf driver must support MSI-X interrupts.

For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to
use with Linux.
.SH SUPPORT

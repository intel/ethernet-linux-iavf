.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
The iavf virtual function (VF) driver supports virtual functions generated by
the physical function (PF) driver, with one or more VFs enabled through sysfs.
.sp
The associated PF drivers for this VF driver are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ice
.IP \(bu 2
i40e
.UNINDENT
.sp
The MTU size set on a VF should match the MTU size set on the PF. A mismatch in
MTU sizes may cause unexpected results.
.sp
SR\-IOV requires the correct platform and OS support.
.sp
The guest OS loading this driver must support MSI\-X interrupts.
.sp
For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel Ethernet adapter. All hardware requirements listed
apply to use with Linux*.
.sp
Driver information can be obtained using ethtool, lspci, and ip.
.SS Adaptive Virtual Function
.sp
Adaptive Virtual Function (AVF) allows the virtual function driver, or VF, to
adapt to changing feature sets of the physical function driver (PF) with which
it is associated. This allows system administrators to update a PF without
having to update all the VFs associated with it. All AVFs have a single common
device ID and branding string.
.sp
AVFs have a minimum set of features known as \(dqbase mode,\(dq but may provide
additional features depending on what features are available in the PF with
which the AVF is associated. The following are base mode features:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
4 Queue Pairs (QP) and associated Configuration Status Registers (CSRs)
for Tx/Rx
.IP \(bu 2

To compile the driver on some kernel/arch combinations, you may need to
install a package with the development version of libelf (e.g., libelf\-dev,
libelf\-devel, elfutils\-libelf\-devel).
.IP \(bu 2
When compiling an out\-of\-tree driver, details will vary by distribution.
However, you will usually need a kernel\-devel RPM or some RPM that provides
the kernel headers at a minimum. The RPM kernel\-devel will usually fill in
the link at \fB/lib/modules/\(aquname \-r\(aq/build\fP\&.

.SH ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND CONFIGURATIONS
.SS Viewing Link Messages
.sp
Link messages will not be displayed to the console if the distribution is
restricting system messages. In order to see network driver link messages on
your console, set dmesg to eight by entering the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.INDENT 3.5
This setting is not saved across reboots.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ethtool
.sp
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest ethtool
version is required for this functionality. Download it at
\X'tty: link https://kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/'\fI\%https://kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/\fP\X'tty: link'\&.
.SS Setting VLAN Tag Stripping
.sp
If you have applications that require Virtual Functions (VFs) to receive
packets with VLAN tags, you can disable VLAN tag stripping for the VF. The
Physical Function (PF) processes requests issued from the VF to enable or
disable VLAN tag stripping.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the PF has assigned a VLAN to a VF, then requests from that VF to
set VLAN tag stripping will be ignored.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

.SS IEEE 802.1ad (QinQ) Support
.sp
The IEEE 802.1ad standard, informally known as QinQ, allows for multiple VLAN
IDs within a single Ethernet frame. VLAN IDs are sometimes referred to as
\(dqtags,\(dq and multiple VLAN IDs are thus referred to as a \(dqtag stack.\(dq Tag stacks
allow L2 tunneling and the ability to separate traffic within a particular VLAN
ID, among other uses.
.sp
The following are examples of how to configure 802.1ad (QinQ):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ip link add link eth0 eth0.24 type vlan proto 802.1ad id 24
ip link add link eth0.24 eth0.24.371 type vlan proto 802.1Q id 371

.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
802.1ad (QinQ) is supported in 3.19 and later kernels.
.IP \(bu 2
VLAN protocols use the following EtherTypes:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP \(bu 2
802.1Q = EtherType 0x8100
.IP \(bu 2
802.1ad = EtherType 0x88A8
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
For QinQ traffic to work at MTU 1500, the L2 peer (switch port or another
NIC) should be able to receive Ethernet frames of 1526 bytes. Some third\-
party NICs support a maximum Ethernet frame size of 1522 bytes at MTU 1500,
which will cause QinQ traffic to fail. To work around this issue, restrict
the MTU on the Intel Ethernet device to 1496.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Double VLANs
.sp
Devices based on the Intel(R) Ethernet 800 Series can process up to two VLANs
in a packet when all the following are installed:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
ice driver version 1.4.0 or later
.IP \(bu 2
NVM version 2.4 or later
.IP \(bu 2
ice DDP package version 1.3.21 or later
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you don\(aqt use the versions above, the only supported VLAN configuration is
single 802.1Q VLAN traffic.
.sp
When two VLAN tags are present in a packet, the outer VLAN tag can be either
802.1Q or 802.1ad. The inner VLAN tag must always be 802.1Q.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Combining QinQ with SR\-IOV VFs
.sp
We recommend you always configure a port VLAN for the VF from the PF. If a port
VLAN is not configured, the VF driver may only offload VLANs via software. The
PF allows all VLAN traffic to reach the VF and the VF manages all VLAN traffic.
.sp
When the device is configured for double VLANs and the PF has configured a port
VLAN:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The VF can only offload guest VLANs for 802.1Q traffic.
.IP \(bu 2
The VF can only configure VLAN filtering rules for guest VLANs using 802.1Q
traffic.
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, when the device is configured for double VLANs and the PF has NOT
configured a port VLAN:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
You must use iavf driver version 4.1.0 or later to offload and filter VLANs.
.IP \(bu 2
The PF turns on VLAN pruning and antispoof in the VF\(aqs VSI by default. The VF
will not transmit or receive any tagged traffic until the VF requests a VLAN
filter.
.IP \(bu 2
The VF can offload (insert and strip) the outer VLAN tag of 802.1Q or 802.1ad
traffic.
.IP \(bu 2
The VF can create filter rules for the outer VLAN tag of both 802.1Q and
802.1ad traffic.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the PF does not support double VLANs, the VF can hardware offload single
802.1Q VLANs without a port VLAN.
.sp
When the PF is enabled for double VLANs, for iavf drivers before version 4.1.x:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
VLAN hardware offloads and filtering are supported only when the PF has
configured a port VLAN.

.SS Application Device Queues (ADQ)
.sp
Application Device Queues (ADQ) allow you to dedicate one or more queues to a
specific application. This can reduce latency for the specified application,

To support VF RDMA, load the irdma driver on the host before creating
VFs. Otherwise VF RDMA support may not be negotiated between the VF and PF
driver.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The iavf driver allocates MSI\-X resources for the VF RDMA instance (irdma). The
LAN iavf driver gets first priority and any leftover MSI\-X interrupts are used
for VF RDMA.
.SS Auxiliary Bus
.sp
Inter\-Driver Communication (IDC) is the mechanism in which LAN drivers (such as
iavf) communicate with peer drivers (such as irdma). Starting in kernel 5.11,
Intel LAN and RDMA drivers use an auxiliary bus mechanism for IDC.
.sp
RDMA functionality requires use of the auxiliary bus.
.sp
If your kernel supports the auxiliary bus, the LAN and RDMA drivers will use
the inbox auxiliary bus for IDC. For kernels lower than 5.11, the base driver
will automatically install an out\-of\-tree auxiliary bus module.
.SH PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
.sp
Driver defaults are meant to fit a wide variety of workloads, but if further
optimization is required, we recommend experimenting with the
settings in this section.

.SS Transmit/Receive Queue Allocation
.sp
The driver allocates a number of transmit/receive queue pairs equal to the
number of local node CPU threads with the following constraints:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The driver will allocate a minimum of 8 queue pairs, or the total number of
CPUs, whichever is lower.
.IP \(bu 2

.UNINDENT
.sp
You can set the number of symmetrical (Rx/Tx) or asymmetrical (mix of combined
and Tx or Rx) queues using the \fBethtool \-L\fP command. Use the \fBcombined\fP
parameter to set the symmetrical part of the configuration, and then use
either \fBrx\fP or \fBtx\fP to set the remaining asymmetrical part of the
configuration. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

\fBethtool\fP preserves the previous values of \fBcombined\fP, \fBrx\fP, and
\fBtx\fP independently, same as it handles flags. If you do not specify
a certain value in the command, it will stay the same instead of being set

.SH KNOWN ISSUES/TROUBLESHOOTING
.SS Software Issues
.sp
If your Intel Ethernet Network Connection is not working after installing the
driver, verify that you have installed the correct driver.
.SS Linux bonding failures with VFs
.sp
If you bind Virtual Functions (VFs) to an Intel(R) Ethernet 700 Series device,
the VF targets may fail when they become the active target. If the MAC address
of the VF is set by the PF (Physical Function) of the device, when you add a
target, or change the active\-backup target, Linux bonding tries to sync the
backup target\(aqs MAC address to the same MAC address as the active target. Linux
bonding will fail at this point. This issue will not occur if the VF\(aqs MAC
address is not set by the PF.
.sp
When using bonding mode 5 (i.e., balance\-tlb or adaptive transmit load
balancing), if you add multiple VFs to the bond, they are assigned duplicate
MAC addresses. When the VFs are joined with the bond interface, the Linux bonding
driver sets the MAC address for the VFs to the same value. The MAC address is
based on the first active VF added to that bond.
.sp
This results in balance\-tlb mode not functioning as expected. PF interfaces
behave as expected. The presence of duplicate MAC addresses may cause further
issues, depending on your switch configuration.
.SS Traffic is not being passed between VM and client
.sp
You may not be able to pass traffic between a client system and a Virtual
Machine (VM) running on a separate host if the Virtual Function (VF, or Virtual
NIC) is not in trusted mode and spoof checking is enabled on the VF.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This situation can occur in any combination of client, host, and guest
operating system. See the readme for the PF driver for information on spoof
checking and how to set the VF to trusted mode.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Using four traffic classes fails
.sp
Do not try to reserve more than three traffic classes in the iavf driver. Doing
so will fail to set any traffic classes and will cause the driver to write
errors to stdout. Use a maximum of three queues to avoid this issue.
.SS Unexpected errors in dmesg when adding TCP filters on the VF
.sp
When ADQ is configured and the VF is not in trusted mode, you may see
unexpected error messages in dmesg on the host when you try to add TCP filters
on the VF. This is due to the asynchronous design of the iavf driver. The VF
does not know whether it is trusted and appears to set the filter, while the PF
blocks the request and reports an error. See the dmesg log in the host OS for
details about the error.
.SS Multiple log error messages on iavf driver removal
.sp
If you have several VFs and you remove the iavf driver, several instances of
the following log errors are written to the log:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Unable to send opcode 2 to PF, err I40E_ERR_QUEUE_EMPTY, aq_err ok
Unable to send the message to VF 2 aq_err 12
ARQ Overflow Error detected
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS MAC address of Virtual Function changes unexpectedly
.sp
If a Virtual Function\(aqs MAC address is not assigned in the host, then the VF
driver will use a random MAC address. This random MAC address may change each
time the VF driver is reloaded. You can assign a static MAC address in the host
machine. This static MAC address will survive a VF driver reload.
.SS Driver buffer overflow fix
.sp

is included in this and future versions of the driver.
.SS Compiling the driver

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Multiple interfaces on same Ethernet broadcast network
.sp
Due to the default ARP behavior on Linux, it is not possible to have one system
on two IP networks in the same Ethernet broadcast domain (non\-partitioned
switch) behave as expected. All Ethernet interfaces will respond to IP traffic
for any IP address assigned to the system. This results in unbalanced receive
traffic.
.sp
If you have multiple interfaces in a server, turn on ARP filtering by
entering the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_filter
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This only works if your kernel\(aqs version is higher than 2.4.5.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This setting is not saved across reboots. The configuration change
can be made permanent by adding the following line to the file
\fB/etc/sysctl.conf\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_filter = 1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

Alternatively, you can install the interfaces in separate broadcast domains
(either in different switches or in a switch partitioned to VLANs).
.SS Rx page allocation errors
.sp
Errors that read, \(dqPage allocation failure. order:0,\(dq may occur under stress
with kernels 2.6.25 and newer. This is caused by the way the Linux kernel reports
this stressed condition.
.SS Host may reboot after removing PF when VF is active in guest
.sp
Kernel versions earlier than 3.2 do not unload the PF driver with active VFs.
Doing this will cause your VFs to stop working until you reload the PF driver.
It can also cause a spontaneous reboot of your system.
.sp
Prior to unloading the PF driver, you must first ensure that all VFs are
no longer active. Do this by shutting down all VMs and unloading the VF driver.
.SS Older VF drivers on Intel Ethernet 800 Series adapters
.sp
Some Windows* VF drivers from Release 22.9 or older may encounter errors when
loaded on a PF, based on the Intel Ethernet 800 Series on Linux KVM. You may see
errors and the VF may not load. This issue does not occur, starting with the
following Windows VF drivers:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
v40e64, v40e65: Version 1.5.65.0 and newer
.UNINDENT
.sp
To resolve this issue, download and install the latest iavf driver.
.SS SR\-IOV virtual functions have identical MAC addresses
.sp
When you create multiple SR\-IOV virtual functions, the VFs may have identical
MAC addresses. Only one VF will pass traffic, and all traffic on other VFs with
identical MAC addresses will fail. This is related to the
\fBMACAddressPolicy=persistent\fP setting in
\fB/usr/lib/systemd/network/99\-default.link\fP\&.
.sp
To resolve this issue, edit the \fB/usr/lib/systemd/network/99\-default.link\fP
file and change the \fBMACAddressPolicy\fP line to \fBMACAddressPolicy=none\fP\&. For
more information, see the systemd.link man page.
